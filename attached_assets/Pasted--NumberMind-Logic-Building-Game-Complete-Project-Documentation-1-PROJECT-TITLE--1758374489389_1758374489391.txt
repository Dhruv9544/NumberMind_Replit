## 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### 3.1 Core Game Concept
NumberMind is a digital adaptation of the classic "Bulls and Cows" logic game, enhanced with modern mobile features and social gameplay elements. Two players compete to guess each other's unique 4-digit number (no repeated digits) using deductive reasoning and strategic thinking.

### 3.2 Game Mechanics

#### **Setup Phase:**
- Each player selects a secret 4-digit number (digits 0-9, no repetitions)
- Numbers are hidden from the opponent
- Example: Player 1 chooses `9843`, Player 2 chooses `3467`

#### **Gameplay Loop:**
1. **Turn-based guessing:** Players alternate making guesses
2. **Feedback system:** After each guess, the opponent provides two key metrics:
   - **Correct Digits:** How many digits in the guess appear in the secret number
   - **Correct Positions:** How many digits are in the exact right position
3. **Deduction phase:** Players use feedback to narrow down possibilities
4. **Victory condition:** First player to guess the exact number wins

#### **Example Round:**
```
Player 1's Secret: 9843
Player 2 guesses: 7324
Feedback: "2 correct digits, 0 in correct positions"
(Digits 3 and 4 exist in 9843, but none are in right positions)
```

### 3.3 Enhanced Features

#### **Difficulty Levels:**
- **Beginner:** 3-digit numbers
- **Standard:** 4-digit numbers
